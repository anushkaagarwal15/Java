You are given a number ’n’.



Find the number of digits of ‘n’ that evenly divide ‘n’.



Note:
A digit evenly divides ‘n’ if it leaves no remainder when dividing ‘n’.


Example:
Input: ‘n’ = 336

Output: 3

Explanation:
336 is divisible by both ‘3’ and ‘6’. Since ‘3’ occurs twice it is counted two times.


public class Solution {
    public static int countDigits(int n){
        // Write your code here.
        int count=0;
        int a = n;

        while(n>0){
            int d = n%10;
            if(d!=0 && a%d==0)
            count++;

         n = n/10;

        }
        return count;
    }
}
